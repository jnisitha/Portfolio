Game development has always been an interesting field for me and for the past year I have been working with several other developers on creating a simple independent game studio named "Adahas".

Initially this was a simple 'test site' of sorts for a project I am currently working on. The 'level' featured here was a learning grounds for me and it contains several free to use textures and sound effects from other sources and creators, as well as assets and animations created by me.  Over time, it has become a place of relaxation for me just to listen to the sounds and walk around the level.

 Everything in the game except textures and sound effects was made by me. The game is made using the Unity Engine and the "lamp" and its animations were created using Blender.

 Currently, I am working on implementing dynamic music (composed by yours truly) using FMOD and implementing a 3rd person playable character with blend animations.
