Helped design a universal calibration block for Bombardier Aerospace.

* The block allowed the operator to vary material type/thickness, flaw size and fastener type.
* The block allowed the operator to complete the required Non-destructive Testing (NDT) inspections (using eddy currents) without renting a custom block every time.
