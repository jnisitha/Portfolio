Introduction to CAD modelling was something I enjoyed immensely and this project was a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hna4V7-FJ08) project that I undertook in order to learn advanced tools in [Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/).

Not only did I learn CAD modelling with solidworks, I also learnt how to use the animation tools and quite a bit about the internal workings of an engine.
