This was an enjoyable simple project undertaken as an introduction to front-end development. This was done as an exercise in '[The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)' course hosted on Udemy.com.

The UI is accomplished through simple html and css. javascript is used to handle game logic. My thanks to the creators of the "Web developer bootcamp" course for this introductory project idea.
