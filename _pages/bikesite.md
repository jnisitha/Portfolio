A blog site where anyone can blog their biking adventures. A hobby project undertaken to satisfy my love for biking on the weekends.

The site was made using the MEAN stack with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) providing additional support and functionality.

The website features a design which allows visitors to view various posts and comments easily and features authentication (implemented through Passport) allowing authenticated users to create posts as well as comment on existing posts.

The front-end is handled through bootstrap complimented by CSS and JS where needed, to keep the UI simple but elegant.

Currently, the site is hosted on AWS (free tier) and new features are on the way! You can read more [here](https://github.com/jnisitha/BikeSite).
