This game was made as an entry for the Mississauga 2018 game jam held at the Microsoft offices in Mississauga. Made in under 48 hours by a team of 3, the game features a "wheel-man" on a tight-rope and a balancing act game mechanic which provides a fun challenge.

The game was made using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)(game engine), [Blender](https://blender.org/) (for 3D-assets modelling), and [Photoshop](https://www.photoshop.com/) for texture creation.

Coding camera movement, player movement and player animations were done by me in addition to modelling and animating the character and texturing.
